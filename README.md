# Hierarchical Data Organizer using Tree-Based Structures

A Java-based system that combines Binary Search Trees (BST) and Max Heaps to efficiently organize and rank complex hierarchical data through recursive algorithms and object-oriented design.

## Features
- Hybrid structure integrating Binary Search Trees (BST) and Max Heaps  
- Recursive algorithms for insertion, deletion, and ranking  
- Custom iterators using Comparable and Iterable interfaces  
- Object-oriented design emphasizing encapsulation and abstraction  

## Technologies
- Java  
- Object-Oriented Programming  
- Data Structures and Algorithms  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/jocelynhou06/bst-heap-hybrid-organizer.git`  
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA  
3. Run `Catfeinated.java` to test functionality
